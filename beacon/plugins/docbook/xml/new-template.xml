<!-- EXAMPLE TUTORIAL FOR FEDORA DOCUMENTATION PROJECT -->
<!-- ================================================= -->

<!-- This file is a self-documenting tutorial for creating DocBook XML -->
<!-- documents for the Fedora Documentation Project. -->

<!-- If you are not interested in learning usage guidelines for DocBook -->
<!-- XML, you do not need to use this file.  You can instead simply copy -->
<!-- one of the template XML files in this directory to start either a -->
<!-- very long document (a "book"), or a shorter tutorial (an -->
<!-- "article").  For most uses, the "article" template is the proper -->
<!-- starting point. -->

<!-- Wherever you see a block of text that has beginning and end markers -->
<!-- that look like this: -->

<!--         -->

<!-- ...you are looking at a COMMENT.  If you have HTML experience, you -->
<!-- have likely seen these markings, or TAGS, before. All of these -->
<!-- comment blocks (other than Line 2, as noted below) are NOT meant to -->
<!-- be copied into your file.  They are only here for your reference. -->
<!-- If you use this file as a template for your own work, delete these -->
<!-- comment blocks. -->

<!-- XML is the eXtensible Markup Language, and is simply a way of -->
<!-- indicating the meaning of content so it can be understood both -->
<!-- manually by human readers and automatically by computer programs. -->
<!-- If you look at the following text, you probably understand that it -->
<!-- is a quote from Shakespeare: -->

<!--    "Alas, poor Yorick!  I knew him, Horatio.              -->
<!--    He hath borne me on his back a thousand times..."      -->
<!--                         W. Shakespeare, _Hamlet_, II:3    -->

<!-- For a computer, however, there is no easy way to derive the sense -->
<!-- of any part of this quotation.  How does the computer understand -->
<!-- what pieces of text are part of the quotation, the author's name, -->
<!-- and so forth?  XML provides both the computer and the human a way -->
<!-- of understanding the role of any input text.  Look at the following -->
<!-- reorganization of this text into XML: -->

<!--
     <quotation>
       <line>Alas, poor Yorick!  I knew him, Horatio.</line>
       <line>He hath borne me on his back a thousand times...</line>
       <citation type="play">
         <author>
           <lastName>Shakespeare</lastName>
           <firstName>W.</firstName>
         </author>
         <title>Hamlet<title>
         <act>2</act>
         <scene>3</scene>
       </citation>
     </quotation>
-->

<!-- There are probably many other ways we could express this content in -->
<!-- XML using a SCHEMA, or set of organizational rules. The Fedora -->
<!-- Documentation Project uses DocBook XML to express documentation -->
<!-- content.  That schema has particular rules for organizing document, -->
<!-- such as articles, chapters, sections, paragraphs, and so forth. -->
<!-- (Note that the XML snippet above is *not* DocBook XML.) -->

<!-- Any type of content can be organized with TAGS, which surround the -->
<!-- content and show what type of role that content fills.  For -->
<!-- instance, in the above XML, each line of the quotation starts with -->
<!-- the opening tag <line> and ends with the closing tag </line>. -->

<!-- These tags mark the beginning and end of ELEMENTS in the XML -->
<!-- document.  An element also may have ATTRIBUTES which further -->
<!-- describe the way an element is to be interpreted.  For example, the -->
<!-- quotation above includes a "citation" element which has a "role" -->
<!-- attribute defined as "play".  An attribute can give both the -->
<!-- computer and the human reader an idea of how the content of a -->
<!-- specific element is properly understood. -->

<!-- Any element tag may be split over two lines.  This is not a problem -->
<!-- for XML documents.  Declarations or tags can have any amount of -->
<!-- whitespace between their internal attributes.  The following two -->
<!-- XML snippets are completely identical as far as the computer is -->
<!-- concerned: -->

<!-- EXAMPLE 1: -->
<!--    <comment role="FIXME">This isn't finished.</comment>         -->

<!-- EXAMPLE 2: -->
<!--    <comment
          role="FIXME">This isn't finished.</comment>                -->

<!-- This is practically all you need to know to get started with -->
<!-- DocBook XML.  You can even copy lines from this document to make -->
<!-- your own template for creating new DocBook XML documents.  Read -->
<!-- further for an explanation of the important lines worth copying. -->

<!-- Lines 1 and 2 of this file are special.  To view them, scroll back -->
<!-- to the beginning of this page.  Their serve the following purposes: -->

<!-- LINE 1:  This line is a declaration line, which indicates this file -->
<!-- is an XML file of some sort.  It is only later that the file is -->
<!-- declared to be a certain type of XML called DocBook XML.  Always -->
<!-- make this the very first line in your DocBook XML file. -->

<!-- LINE 2:  This comment line is a special line used for revision -->
<!-- control.  If you use a revision control system, like CVS or -->
<!-- Subversion, that system can substitute special text inside the -->
<!-- comment line.  Always make this the second line in your DocBook XML -->
<!-- file. -->

<!-- Following this comment block is an element which points to a -->
<!-- Document Type Declaration, or DTD, which will inform any capable -->
<!-- editor program how to treat the XML content. -->

<!--<!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.4//EN"
"http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd" [ -->

<!-- Here is the meaning of each attribute in the DTD pointer: -->
<!-- DOCTYPE : This is a DOCTYPE element that points to a DTD. -->
<!-- article : The root, or top, element in this document is <article>. -->
<!-- PUBLIC  : The DTD for this document is publicly available. -->
<!-- "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.4//EN" : The "formal public
               identifier" (FPI) for the DTD for this document.  *Every
               DocBook XML version 4.4 document uses this exact FPI.* -->
<!-- "http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd" : A URL that points
               to the DTD with the FPI above.  There are other URLs that
               also point to this DTD, but it is always safe to use this
               one. (It's important to have a good URL here if your XML
               editor is DTD-aware, since it will allow your editor to
               help you write your document.) -->

<!-- The DOCTYPE element states that the document's root, or first, -->
<!-- element must be an "article" element.  That is the next thing that -->
<!-- should appear in the document.  Note this article has an ID -->
<!-- attribute.  Almost *any* DocBook element can have an ID attribute, -->
<!-- but they are most useful for bigger organizational elements, like -->
<!-- an article, chapter, or section; or for marking specific elements -->
<!-- which you want to cross-reference from other parts of the document. -->

<!-- Between the [ and ] markers are a set of declarations known as the -->
<!-- document's INTERNAL SUBSET.  The author can declare additional -->
<!-- directives for processing here.  The FDP uses the following -->
<!-- standard lines for all internal subsets.  Authors may add to them -->
<!-- if needed, but it is not recommended for reasons of translation and -->
<!-- localization. -->

<!-- XML files often use ENTITIES to simplify and reduce errors in -->
<!-- usage.  Those entities typically allow the author to use shorthand -->
<!-- that expands to other text, such as using &FDP; to represent the -->
<!-- text "Fedora Documentation Project".  The declarations below -->
<!-- are themselves entities, as you can see from the fact that they -->
<!-- start with the "!ENTITY" identifier.  These entries are a special -->
<!-- kind of entity that load additional files containing the actual -->
<!-- general entities. -->

<article id="example-tutorial">
    <title>Example Article</title>
<!-- As mentioned before, DocBook XML is a particular schema used to -->
<!-- organize content for technical documentation.  The schema is -->
<!-- described by a DTD, which lays out the rules for organizing -->
<!-- elements and content.  If you want to know what elements can be -->
<!-- used in what order, you could read the DTD to find out.  That's a -->
<!-- really difficult thing to do, though, even for people who are -->
<!-- well-versed in DTDs.  Instead, you can read (and download) -->
<!-- "DocBook: The Definitive Guide" at the following URL: -->

<!--       http://www.docbook.org/          -->

<!-- Once you've established the root element, if you're not writing -->
<!-- strictly for the Fedora Documentation Project, you are free to -->
<!-- write and organize content in any way you want, as long as your -->
<!-- organization is VALID, meaning it follows the DTD.  The content -->
<!-- that follows is merely a typical example. -->

<!-- However, if you are writing for the FDP (and the rest of this -->
<!-- tutorial assumes you are, since you downloaded it!), there are some -->
<!-- additional rules to follow.  Otherwise your document may not work -->
<!-- with the FDP tools for publication and dissemination. -->

<!-- The next element is a way to include metadata, or descriptive -->
<!-- information, about this document.  It is peculiar to the FDP. -->

  <xi:include href="fdp-info.xml"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <xi:fallback>CHECK "rpm-info.xml"!</xi:fallback>
  </xi:include>

<!-- FDP articles require an additional XML file called "rpm-info.xml" -->
<!-- which includes information about the title, author, copyright, and -->
<!-- revision history for this document.  That file is transformed into -->
<!-- a new file called "fdp-info.xml" which is then included as part of -->
<!-- this document.  (XML provides all sorts of fascinating -->
<!-- opportunities for reusing information in this way.)  If for some -->
<!-- reason your "rpm-info.xml" is missing or wrong, only the text -->
<!-- snippet 'CHECK "rpm-info-xml"!' appears in your document, alerting -->
<!-- you that something is wrong.  Technically, no xi:fallback element -->
<!-- is required, since an fdp-info.xml failure will simply cause the -->
<!-- document validation or building to fail with noisy errors. -->

<!-- Typically, the next element is a "section" element.  You can nest -->
<!-- "section" elements inside each other to organize content.  Many -->
<!-- writers like to lay out their "section" elements like an outline, -->
<!-- which allows them to visualize the flow of their documents before -->
<!-- they start writing in earnest. -->

<!-- NOTE: Some documents use "sect1," "sect2," and "sect3" elements to -->
<!-- denote organizational depth.  A "sect1" is a first-level section, a -->
<!-- "sect2" is second-level, and so forth.  Unfortunately these -->
<!-- elements make sections less portable and harder to rearrange if you -->
<!-- change your mind about organization, so FDP recommends against -->
<!-- their use. -->

<!-- The following snippet is a very simple use of a "section" -->
<!-- element. -->

  <section id="sn-small-section">
<!-- You should give every section in your document a title. -->
    <title>A Small Section</title>
<!-- If you want to mark content in your document for indexing,
    simply place an "indexterm" element prior to the content to be
    indexed.  To include multiple index entries pointing to the
    following content, use more than one "indexterm" element. -->
    <indexterm>
      <primary>sect1, sect2, and sect3</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      This is an example section. You should not use
      <sgmltag
  class="element">sect1</sgmltag>
      ,
      <sgmltag
  class="element">sect2</sgmltag>
      , and
      <sgmltag
  class="element">sect3</sgmltag>
      , since those tags will make sections less modular and harder to
      relocate without changing a lot of other markup.

<!-- elements which appear frequently in our documentation. -->
